## Agent Collaboration Patterns

### Collaborative Workflow:
```
User ↔ UserProxy ↔ ContentPlanner (strategic planning)
                ↔ ContentManagement (technical feasibility)  
                ↔ Supervisor (coordination & validation)
                ↓
    Detailed KB Design → Autonomous Agent Work Begins
```

### GitLab Integration:
- All agents integrate with GitLab for work assignment and tracking
- Agents communicate through GitLab issues and comments
- Work validation and status reporting through GitLab workflows
- Autonomous agent coordination through GitLab project management

### Specialization Hierarchy:
1. **User Interface**: UserProxy
2. **Strategy & Planning**: ContentPlanner
3. **Content Operations**: ContentManagement, ContentCreator, ContentReviewer
4. **Information Retrieval**: ContentRetrieval
5. **Quality & Oversight**: Supervisor
6. **System Coordination**: Orchestrator
7. **State Management**: PostgreSQLStateManager

This multi-agent system provides comprehensive knowledge base creation, management, and optimization capabilities with robust GitLab integration for autonomous operation and collaboration.
