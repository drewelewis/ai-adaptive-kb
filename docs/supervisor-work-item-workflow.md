# Supervisor & Content Management Agent Work Item Workflow - Multi-KB Environment

## üö® Enhanced Autonomous Content Generation

**The system now provides fully autonomous content generation through Content Management Agent prescriptive workflow orchestration.**

The enhanced workflow eliminates manual bottlenecks by empowering the Content Management Agent to automatically create comprehensive content work item pipelines when "Define KB" gates are closed.

## ‚ö° Prescriptive Automation Solution

### Content Management Agent's New Role:
- **Gate Monitoring**: Automatically detects when "Define KB: [KB Name]" work items are closed
- **Prescriptive Workflow Creation**: Automatically creates complete content work item pipelines
- **Autonomous Trigger Authority**: Eliminates the need for manual work item creation after gate closure
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Defines standardized approaches that other agents autonomously execute

## üö™ Enhanced "Define KB" Gate Process

1. **Supervisor creates "Define KB: [KB Name]" work item** (state: opened)
2. **Content agents contribute planning input** through comments and suggestions
3. **Human stakeholders provide feedback** and requirements clarification
4. **KB definition is finalized** with clear scope and structure
5. **Human closes "Define KB" work item** (state: closed) ‚Üê **AUTONOMOUS TRIGGER POINT**
6. **üöÄ Content Management Agent automatically creates content pipeline** 
   - Research work items ‚Üí ContentRetrieval
   - Planning work items ‚Üí ContentPlanner
   - Creation work items ‚Üí ContentCreator
   - Review work items ‚Üí ContentReviewer
7. **All content agents autonomously execute assigned work items**

## üåê Multi-KB Environment Awareness

All agents work across **MULTIPLE KNOWLEDGE BASES** and must maintain context awareness:
- Every work item must specify the target knowledge base
- Agents verify KB context before executing any operations
- No mixing of content or operations between different KBs
- Clear KB identification in all communications and work items

## Workflow Overview

```
UserProxy ‚Üí Knowledge Base Selection/Creation
    ‚Üì
UserProxy ‚Üí Handoff to Supervisor with full context
    ‚Üì
Supervisor ‚Üí MUST create GitLab work items immediately
    ‚Üì
Content Agent Swarm ‚Üí Discovers and executes supervisor-created work items
```

## Supervisor Responsibilities

### 1. Immediate "Define KB" Work Item Creation
- Upon receiving KB handoff from UserProxy, the Supervisor **MUST** create a "Define KB" work item
- This is the **FIRST ACTION** required after handoff reception
- **Use standardized naming convention**: "Define KB: [KB Name]"
- This work item serves as a **MANDATORY GATE** for all content creation
- Content agents can contribute input but **CANNOT create content** until this work item is **CLOSED**
- Work item must include all available KB details, requirements, and context

### 2. Work Item Content Requirements
Each work item must include:
- **Target KB Identification**: Specific knowledge base name/ID and context
- **KB Context**: Complete background and strategic purpose for that specific KB
- **Requirements**: Clear success criteria and deliverables for the target KB
- **Agent Assignment**: Specific agent assignments or labels
- **Priority Level**: High/Medium/Low priority designation
- **Success Criteria**: Clear definition of completion for the specific KB
- **KB Domain Context**: Topic area and scope of the target knowledge base

### 3. Work Item Updates
- If KB details change over time, Supervisor must update existing work items
- Changes to requirements must be reflected in GitLab work items
- Content agents rely on work items for current requirements

## Content Agent Behavior

### Work Discovery Process
Content agents check GitLab for:
- Work items **created by the Supervisor Agent**
- Items assigned to their specific agent type
- Items with appropriate labels and priorities
- **Items with clear KB context specification**
- Open issues requiring attention for specific knowledge bases

### Waiting State
When no supervisor-created work items exist:
- Content agents report "waiting for supervisor work items"
- No content work will begin
- Agents check each cycle for new supervisor work items

### KB Context Verification
Before executing any work:
- Agents verify the target knowledge base specified in work items
- Confirm KB context before using any knowledge base tools
- Ensure all operations target the correct knowledge base
- Never mix operations between different KBs

## Implementation Details

### Content Agent Swarm Messages
- Agents explicitly check for "supervisor-created" work items
- Clear messaging when waiting for supervisor work items
- Initialization displays dependency on supervisor work items

### Supervisor Prompts
- Emphasize immediate work item creation requirement
- Clear workflow steps including mandatory work item creation
- Updates when KB requirements change

### UserProxy Handoff
- UserProxy informs Supervisor of work item creation requirement
- Complete context transfer to enable immediate work item creation
- Clear transition of responsibility

## Benefits

1. **Clear Coordination**: Ensures all work is properly planned and assigned
2. **Human Oversight**: Supervisor can incorporate human feedback before work begins
3. **Quality Control**: Work items provide clear success criteria and context
4. **Dependency Management**: Content agents know exactly what to work on
5. **Change Management**: Updates flow through supervisor to all content agents

## Standardized Work Item Naming Conventions

To ensure consistency and easy discovery across multiple knowledge bases, the Supervisor must use standardized naming conventions for all work items:

### üìã **Standard Work Item Titles**

- **KB Initialization**: `KB-INIT: [KB Name] - Knowledge Base Setup & Analysis`
- **Content Planning**: `KB-PLAN: [KB Name] - Content Planning & Strategy` 
- **Content Creation**: `KB-CREATE: [KB Name] - Content Development`
- **Content Review**: `KB-REVIEW: [KB Name] - Quality Assurance & Review`
- **Content Research**: `KB-RESEARCH: [KB Name] - Research & Analysis`
- **KB Updates**: `KB-UPDATE: [KB Name] - Knowledge Base Updates`

### üè∑Ô∏è **Naming Convention Benefits**

1. **Easy Filtering**: Agents can filter work items by KB prefix
2. **Clear Purpose**: Work type is immediately identifiable
3. **KB Context**: Knowledge base name is always visible
4. **Consistent Discovery**: Predictable naming for automated discovery
5. **Multi-KB Management**: Clear separation between different KBs

### üìù **Initial Setup Work Item Example**

```
Title: KB-INIT: Digital Marketing Strategy - Knowledge Base Setup & Analysis
Labels: kb-init, supervisor-created, high-priority, digital-marketing
Assignee: ContentManagementAgent

Description:
- Target KB: Digital Marketing Strategy
- KB Domain: Digital marketing best practices, tools, and strategies
- Initial Setup: Create new knowledge base in the system
- Analysis Required: Evaluate scope and structure requirements
- Team Coordination: Coordinate with all content agents for comprehensive analysis
```

## Example Work Item Structure

```markdown
Title: KB-INIT: [KB Name] - Knowledge Base Setup & Analysis
Labels: kb-init, supervisor-created, priority-level, kb-domain
Assignee: ContentManagementAgent (for initial setup)

Description:
- Target KB: [Specific Knowledge Base Name/ID]
- KB Domain: [Topic area and scope of the KB]
- KB Context: [Strategic purpose and background for this specific KB]
- Setup Requirements: [KB creation, structure initialization, context setting]
- Analysis Requirements: [Content gap analysis, structure assessment, research needs]
- Team Coordination: [Assign follow-up work to specialized content agents]
- Success Criteria: [KB created, initial analysis complete, work items created for content agents]
- Human Input: [Any specific human requirements or feedback for this KB]
- Next Steps: [Planned work items for ContentPlanner, ContentCreator, etc.]
```

This workflow ensures proper coordination between the Supervisor and content agent swarm while maintaining clear KB context awareness and preventing cross-KB contamination.
