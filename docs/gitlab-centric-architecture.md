# GitLab-Centric Multi-Agent Architecture

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive GitLab-centric architecture where all content agents work independently and communicate exclusively through GitLab, with the Supervisor Agent coordinating work through GitLab project management.

## Architectural Transformation

### **Key Changes from Previous Architecture**
- **No Direct Agent Communication**: Content agents no longer communicate directly with each other or the Supervisor
- **GitLab as Central Hub**: All work assignment, coordination, and communication happens through GitLab
- **Independent Agent Operation**: Each content agent operates autonomously, checking GitLab for work assignments
- **Strategic Coordination**: Supervisor works with ContentPlanner for holistic resource management through GitLab

- **Basic Operations**: Execute simple KB operations like context setting and basic retrievals
- **GitLab Integration**: Maintain work tracking for simple operations
- **Legacy Support**: Provide backward compatibility for existing workflows
- **Direct Operations**: Handle operations that don't require multi-agent coordination

## GitLab Workflow Patterns

### **Strategic Planning Workflow**
```
User Request → Supervisor Analysis → GitLab Strategic Planning Issue
                                           ↓
ContentPlanner Assignment → Strategic Analysis → Implementation Plan
                                           ↓
GitLab Issue Templates → Content Agent Assignments → Coordinated Execution
```

### **Content Creation Workflow**
```
Strategic Plan → GitLab Content Creation Issues → ContentCreator Assignment
                                                        ↓
Content Creation → Progress Updates → Completion Notification
                                                        ↓
GitLab Review Assignment → ContentReviewer → Quality Assessment
                                                        ↓
Revision Coordination → Final Approval → Publication Ready Status
```

### **Cross-Agent Collaboration Pattern**
```
Agent A creates GitLab issue/comment → GitLab notification system
                                              ↓
Agent B checks GitLab → Responds through GitLab → Work coordination
                                              ↓
All agents monitor GitLab → Collaborative workflow → Shared outcomes
```

## GitLab Integration Components
