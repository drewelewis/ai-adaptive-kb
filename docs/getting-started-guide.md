# Getting Started Guide - Autonomous Content Creation System

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Instructions

### Step 1: Update Your Orchestrator

Your existing `orchestrator.py` needs to be updated to include the new specialized agents.

**Option A: Quick Test (Minimal Changes)**
Add the new agents to your existing orchestrator without major restructuring.

**Option B: Full Integration (Recommended)**
Update the orchestrator to properly support the autonomous content creation workflow.

### Step 2: Environment Setup

Ensure your environment variables are configured:

```bash
# PostgreSQL Database (already configured)
POSTGRES_HOST=your_host
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB=your_db
POSTGRES_USER=your_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password

# Azure OpenAI (already configured)
OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint
OPENAI_API_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your_deployment
OPENAI_API_VERSION=your_version
```

### Step 3: Quick Test Workflow

1. **Import New Agents** in your main entry point
2. **Test Basic Creation** with a simple KB request
3. **Validate PostgreSQL Integration** 
4. **Test Full Autonomous Workflow**

## ðŸŽ¯ Choose Your Implementation Path

### Option A: Quick Test Integration

**Pros**: 
- Minimal changes to existing code
- Test new agents immediately
- Keep existing functionality intact

**Cons**: 
- Not fully optimized workflow
- Manual agent coordination required

### Option B: Full Autonomous Integration

**Pros**: 
- Complete autonomous content creation pipeline
- Optimized agent coordination
- Production-ready implementation

**Cons**: 
- Requires more orchestrator changes
- Need to update routing logic
