# Content Creation & Optimization Agent Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of specialized agents for content creation, optimization, and knowledge base management. The system is designed for content quality and generation rather than end-user search, with outputs used for ebooks, blogs, books, and other publishing workflows.

## System Purpose
- **Primary Goal**: Create comprehensive, in-depth knowledge bases from high-level ideas
- **Content Quality**: Domain expertise, comprehensive coverage, clear understanding
- **Autonomy Level**: High autonomy with intelligent clarification when needed
- **Interaction Model**: Collaborative but not chat-dependent - system works independently
- **End Use**: Content feeds into publishing workflows (ebooks, blogs, books)
- **Scope**: Content-agnostic system for any knowledge base domain

## Operational Philosophy
- **Input**: High-level KB ideas and concepts
- **Process**: Autonomous research, structure, and content creation
- **Intervention**: System prompts for clarification only when necessary
- **Output**: Publication-ready, comprehensive knowledge bases

2. Router: Classifies as comprehensive content creation
3. ContentPlanner: 
   - Analyzes scope and determines comprehensive structure
   - May ask: "Focus on small-scale/industrial farming? Specific regions?"
   - Creates detailed content strategy and article hierarchy
4. ContentCreator: 
   - Researches and writes in-depth articles autonomously
   - Creates comprehensive coverage of all identified topics
   - Builds cross-references and relationships
5. ContentReviewer:
   - Reviews for completeness and domain accuracy
