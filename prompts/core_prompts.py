Knowledge bases serve as comprehensive information repositories for specific topics that will later be repurposed for:
- Marketing materials and campaigns
- E-books and digital publications  
- Blog articles and blog posts
- Educational content and courses
- White papers and industry reports

The focus during creation is on building robust content foundations rather than immediate application.
Each knowledge base becomes a strategic content asset for multiple future projects.

        """Core hierarchy requirements - used by all content agents"""
        return """
**FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE BASE HIERARCHY - UNIVERSAL STANDARD:**

**Core Hierarchy Pattern - Category > Subcategory > Child Article:**
ALL knowledge base content MUST follow this foundational three-tier structure:

1. **üìÅ CATEGORIES (parent_id=null)** - Main topic areas (3-8 categories)
   - Root-level articles that define broad subject domains
   - Examples: "Financial Planning", "Software Development", "Project Management"
   - Content: High-level introductory material, domain overview, foundational concepts
   - Titles: Short (2-4 words), categorical organization, general concepts

2. **üìÇ SUBCATEGORIES (parent_id=category_id)** - Detailed organization (2-6 per category)
   - Articles that break down categories into specific focus areas
   - Examples: Under "Financial Planning": "Retirement Planning", "Investment Strategies"
   - Content: Specialized knowledge within the category domain
   - Depth: Focused expertise for specific aspects of the parent category

3. **üìÑ CHILD ARTICLES (parent_id=subcategory_id)** - Specific actionable content
   - Detailed articles with practical, implementable information
   - Examples: Under "Investment Strategies": "401k Optimization", "Dollar-Cost Averaging"
   - Content: Practical, implementable knowledge with specific techniques
   - Depth: Comprehensive implementation guidance with actionable steps

**HIERARCHY IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Categories: Always use parent_id=null for root-level topic containers
- Subcategories: Always use parent_id=<category_article_id> for focused topic areas
- Child Articles: Always use parent_id=<subcategory_article_id> for specific content
- No skipping levels: Child articles cannot be directly under categories
- No orphaned content: Every article must have proper hierarchical placement

**SMART CATEGORY EXPANSION LOGIC - UNIVERSAL STANDARD:**
ALL agents must follow this intelligent approach to Level 1 category expansion:

1. **FOUNDATION PHASE (0-3 categories)**:
   - Create 2-3 foundational categories that cover core topic areas
   - Focus on essential, broad categories that define the knowledge domain
   - Prioritize comprehensive coverage over quantity

2. **STRATEGIC EXPANSION PHASE (4-6 categories)**:
   - Only create new Level 1 categories if they represent ESSENTIAL missing topics
   - New categories must significantly enhance knowledge base completeness
   - Evaluate whether the knowledge base topic scope genuinely warrants expansion
   - Consider if content could be better organized as Level 2 subcategories instead

3. **CONSOLIDATION PHASE (7+ categories)**:
   - STOP creating new Level 1 categories - focus on Level 2 subcategories and Level 3 articles
   - Too many Level 1 categories creates cognitive overload and poor navigation
   - Prioritize deepening existing categories rather than expanding breadth
   - If essential topics remain, consider reorganizing existing structure

**EXPANSION DECISION CRITERIA:**
- Does this new category represent a fundamentally different domain within the topic?
- Would this content be better organized as a subcategory under existing categories?
- Does the knowledge base topic scope genuinely support this level of breadth?
- Will adding this category enhance or complicate user navigation and understanding?

This logic ensures knowledge bases grow intelligently rather than arbitrarily expanding."""

- Human users are active participants in GitLab alongside agents
- Use GitLab issues, comments, and discussions to ask questions when anything is unclear
- Monitor GitLab continuously for human feedback, guidance, and answers
