**FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE BASE ARCHITECTURE - UNIVERSAL STANDARD:**

**Core Hierarchy Pattern - Category > Subcategory > Child Article:**
ALL knowledge base content MUST follow this foundational three-tier structure:

1. **üìÅ CATEGORIES (parent_id=null)** - Main topic areas that serve as logical containers
   - Root-level articles that define broad subject domains
   - Examples: "Financial Planning", "Software Development", "Project Management"
   - Should provide comprehensive overview of the entire topic area
   - Content: High-level introductory material, domain overview, foundational concepts
   - Depth: Broad coverage establishing the topic's scope and importance

2. **üìÇ SUBCATEGORIES (parent_id=category_id)** - Detailed organization under categories
   - Articles that break down categories into specific focus areas
   - Examples: Under "Financial Planning": "Retirement Planning", "Investment Strategies", "Tax Planning"
   - Should provide focused guidance within the broader category context
   - Content: Specialized knowledge within the category domain
   - Depth: Targeted expertise for specific aspects of the parent category

3. **üìÑ CHILD ARTICLES (parent_id=subcategory_id)** - Specific actionable content
   - Detailed articles with practical, implementable information
   - Examples: Under "Investment Strategies": "401k Optimization Techniques", "Dollar-Cost Averaging Guide"
   - Should contain step-by-step guidance, examples, and actionable insights
   - Content: Practical, implementable knowledge with specific techniques and examples
   - Depth: Comprehensive implementation guidance with actionable steps

**HIERARCHY IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**

**Article Creation Standards:**
- Categories: Always use parent_id=null for root-level topic containers
- Subcategories: Always use parent_id=<category_article_id> for focused topic areas
- Child Articles: Always use parent_id=<subcategory_article_id> for specific content
- No skipping levels: Child articles cannot be directly under categories
- No orphaned content: Every article must have proper hierarchical placement

**Content Depth by Level:**
- Categories: 300-500 words of broad topic introduction and overview
- Subcategories: 500-800 words of focused domain expertise
- Child Articles: 800-1500 words of detailed, actionable implementation guidance

**Navigation and User Experience:**
- Users should naturally flow from general (category) to specific (child article)
- Each level should provide logical progression to the next level
- Cross-references between related subcategories and child articles
- Clear breadcrumb navigation through the hierarchy

**Quality Standards:**
- Balanced structure: Avoid too many orphaned articles or overly deep nesting
- Consistent depth: Content depth should match the hierarchical level
- Logical grouping: Related content should be grouped under appropriate subcategories
- Complete coverage: Categories should fully cover their domain through subcategories

        Universal tagging and content organization principles.
        All agents must implement consistent tagging strategies.
        """
        return """
**FOUNDATIONAL TAGGING AND ORGANIZATION SYSTEM:**

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: ALL CONTENT MUST BE TAGGED**
Every article created in the knowledge base MUST have appropriate tags applied immediately upon creation. No article should exist without proper tagging.

**Core Tagging Categories (ALL knowledge bases must implement):**

1. **Skill Level Tags (MANDATORY - every article needs one):**
   - "beginner" - Introductory content for new learners
   - "intermediate" - Content requiring basic foundation knowledge  
   - "advanced" - Expert-level content with complex concepts
   - "expert" - Specialized content for domain experts

2. **Content Type Tags (MANDATORY - every article needs one):**
   - "overview" - High-level introductory material (typically categories)
   - "guide" - Step-by-step instructional content
   - "reference" - Quick-lookup factual information
   - "tutorial" - Hands-on learning content with examples
   - "best-practices" - Proven approaches and methodologies
   - "troubleshooting" - Problem-solving and debugging content

3. **Domain-Specific Tags (MANDATORY - minimum 1 per article):**
   - Create 10-20 tags specific to the knowledge base subject matter
   - Use consistent naming conventions (lowercase, hyphen-separated)
   - Examples: "financial-planning", "retirement-401k", "investment-strategy"
   - Must align with knowledge base's primary domain and topic areas

4. **Application Context Tags (RECOMMENDED - adds value):**
   - "practical" - Real-world implementation focused
   - "theoretical" - Conceptual understanding focused
   - "case-study" - Example-driven content
   - "checklist" - Action-oriented task lists

**MANDATORY Tagging Implementation Requirements:**
- Every article MUST have minimum 3-4 relevant tags: skill-level + content-type + domain-specific(s)
- Categories typically tagged: [domain-tag, "overview", skill-level]
- Subcategories typically tagged: [domain-tag, content-type, skill-level, application-context]  
- Child articles typically tagged: [specific-domain-tag, "guide"/"tutorial", skill-level, "practical"]

**REQUIRED Tag Creation Workflow:**
1. Before creating any article: Assess existing tags using KnowledgeBaseGetTagsByKnowledgeBase
2. Create missing foundational tags using KnowledgeBaseInsertTag
3. Apply tags to articles immediately after creation using KnowledgeBaseAddTagToArticle or KnowledgeBaseSetArticleTags
4. Maintain consistency across related content
5. Verify tagging completeness before considering any content creation task complete

**Agent Responsibilities:**
- ContentCreatorAgent: MUST tag all created articles immediately after insertion
- ContentManagementAgent: MUST verify proper tagging across knowledge base
- ContentReviewerAgent: MUST include tag review in content quality assessment
- All agents: MUST ensure no untagged content exists in the knowledge base

**FOUNDATIONAL CONTENT QUALITY STANDARDS:**

**Writing Standards:**
- Professional, authoritative tone appropriate for publication
- Clear, concise language accessible to the target audience
- Proper grammar, spelling, and formatting consistency
- Active voice preferred over passive voice
- Logical flow from introduction to conclusion

**Structure Requirements:**
- Use # for main title, ## for major sections, ### for subsections
- Include practical examples and actionable advice
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity
- Provide clear headings and subheadings for navigation
- Include relevant cross-references to related articles

**Content Completeness:**
- Address the topic comprehensively for the hierarchical level
- Include relevant examples and use cases
- Provide actionable guidance where appropriate
- Reference authoritative sources when applicable
- Maintain consistency with related content in the knowledge base

**Publication Readiness:**
- Content should be ready for immediate repurposing into marketing materials, e-books, blog posts
- Include metadata and tagging for content discoverability
- Ensure proper formatting for multiple output formats
- Maintain professional presentation standards

**FOUNDATIONAL AGENT COLLABORATION PRINCIPLES:**

**GitLab-Centric Coordination:**
- All inter-agent communication happens through GitLab issues and comments
- Agents discover work by scanning GitLab projects and issues
- Progress updates and status reports use GitLab issue updates
- Work assignment and collaboration coordination through GitLab workflows

**Hierarchy Compliance Workflow:**
1. **Planning Phase**: ContentPlanner establishes hierarchy strategy
2. **Creation Phase**: ContentCreator implements hierarchy with proper parent_id relationships
3. **Review Phase**: ContentReviewer validates hierarchy compliance and content quality
4. **Supervision Phase**: SupervisorAgent oversees and corrects hierarchy violations

**Quality Assurance Chain:**
- Every content creation action must follow the foundational hierarchy pattern
- Any deviation from Category > Subcategory > Child Article structure triggers review
- Supervisor makes judgment calls when patterns don't align with foundational approach
- Corrective actions coordinated through GitLab issue assignment

**Autonomous Operation Principles:**
- Agents work independently by discovering and claiming appropriate work items
- Focus on work that matches agent capabilities and expertise areas
- Maintain system-wide consistency through shared foundational understanding
- Escalate conflicts or uncertainties through GitLab issue collaboration
